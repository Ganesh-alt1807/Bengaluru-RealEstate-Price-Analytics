## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Bengaluru real estate data to understand factors that influence housing prices such as:
- Unit Size
- Micro Market location
- Connectivity Score
- Amenities Score
- Locality Infrastructure Score
- Traffic Time

The goal is to provide insights into price variations across different micro-markets in Bengaluru and identify key drivers of pricing.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Ticket prices range between **₹1 Cr – ₹70+ Cr**
- **Location is the strongest price driver**
- Micro-markets like **Koramangala, Whitefield, MG Road** show higher price trends
- Unit size has a weak correlation with price → premium doesn’t always mean bigger flats
- Connectivity & amenities have slight influence but not major drivers

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- Price Distribution (Histogram & KDE)
- Boxplot of Ticket Prices
- Scatterplots:
  - Price vs Unit Size
  - Price vs Connectivity Score
